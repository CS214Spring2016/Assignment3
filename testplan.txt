Test 1 (single file):
test 1 was performed on a single file in the root directory using the file "new.txt". The file contained the phrase: "This other are words.".
The program outputted correctly and stripped the punctuation, as well as made everything lowercase.

Test 2 (directory):
Test 2 was performed on a directory (test) and contained the previous text file "new.txt" as well as "new2.txt".
The program saw the repeated use of the word "this" and correctly identified it, as well as printing everything else correctly.
